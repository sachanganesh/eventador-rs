# seam-rs

This crate provides tools for building reliable, fault-tolerant, distributed systems.

- [seam-channel](seam-channel): message queue abstraction over traditional network I/O

## Roadmap

- seam-partition: distributed hash-table algorithms to partition elements across network
- seam-membership: membership algorithms to determine node joins and leaves
- seam-failure: failure detection algorithms
